            "From Trade to Territory The Company Establishes Power 2 Aurangzeb was the last of the powerful Mughal rulers  He established control over a very large part of the territory that is now known as India  After his death in 1707  many Mughal governors  subadars  and big zamindars began asserting their authority and establishing regional kingdoms  As powerful regional kingdoms emerged in various parts of India  Delhi could no longer function as an effective centre  By the second half of the eighteenth century  however  a new power was emerging on the political horizon  the British  Did you know that the British originally came as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories  How then did they come to be masters of a vast empire  In this chapter you will see how this came about  Fig  1  Bahadur Shah Zafar and his sons being arrested by Captain Hodson After Aurangzeb there was no powerful Mughal ruler  but Mughal emperors continued to be symbolically important  In fact  when a massive rebellion against British rule broke out in 1857  Bahadur Shah Zafar  the Mughal emperor at the time  was seen as the natural leader  Once the revolt was put down by the company  Bahadur Shah Zafar was forced to leave the kingdom  and his sons were shot in cold blood  Rationalised 202324 10 OUR PASTS  III East India Company Comes East In 1600  the East India Company acquired a charter from the ruler of England  Queen Elizabeth I  granting it the sole right to trade with the East  This meant that no other trading group in England could compete with the East India Company  With this charter  the Company could venture across the oceans  looking for new lands from which it could buy goods at a cheap price  and carry them back to Europe to sell at higher prices  The Company did not have to fear competition from other English trading companies  Mercantile trading companies in those days made profit primarily by excluding competition  so that they could buy cheap and sell dear  The royal charter  however  could not prevent other European powers from entering the Eastern markets  By the time the first English ships sailed down the west coast of Africa  round the Cape of Good Hope  and crossed the Indian Ocean  the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India  and had their base in Goa  In fact  it was Vasco da Gama  a Portuguese explorer  who had discovered this sea route to India in 1498  By the early seventeenth century  the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean  Soon the French traders arrived on the scene  The problem was that all the companies were interested in buying the same things  The fine qualities of cotton and silk produced in India had a big market in Europe  Pepper  cloves  cardamom and cinnamon too were in great demand  Competition amongst the European companies inevitably pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased  and this reduced the profits that could be earned  The only way the trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors  The urge to secure markets  therefore  led to fierce battles between the trading companies  Through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they regularly sank each other  s ships  blockaded routes  and prevented rival ships from moving with supplies of Fig  2

TRADE TO TERRITORY 11 goods  Trade was carried on with arms and trading posts were protected through fortification  This effort to fortify settlements and carry on profitable trade also led to intense conflict with local rulers  The company therefore found it difficult to separate trade from politics  Let us see how this happened  East India Company begins trade in Bengal The first English factory was set up on the banks of the river Hugli in 1651  This was the base from which the Company  s traders  known at that time as  factors   operated  The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored  and it had offices where Company officials sat  As trade expanded  the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory  By 1696  it began building a fort around the settlement  Two years later  it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages  One of these was Kalikata  which later grew into the city of Calcutta or Kolkata as it is known today  It also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty free  The Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges  Aurangzeb  s farman  for instance  had granted only the Company the right to trade duty free  But officials of the Company  who were carrying on private trade on the side  were expected to pay duty  This they refused to pay  causing an enormous loss of revenue for Bengal  How could the Nawab of Bengal  Murshid Quli Khan  not protest  Fig  3  Local boats bring goods from ships in Madras  painted by William Simpson  1867 Farman  A royal edict  a royal order Rationalised 202324 12 OUR PASTS  III How trade led to battles Through the early eighteenth century  the conflict between the Company and the nawabs of Bengal intensified  After the death of Aurangzeb  the Bengal nawabs asserted their power and autonomy  as other regional powers were doing at that time  Murshid Quli Khan was followed by Alivardi Khan and then Sirajuddaulah as the Nawab of Bengal  Each one of them was a strong ruler  They refused to grant the Company concessions  demanded large tributes for the Company  s right to trade  denied it any right to mint coins  and stopped it from extending its fortifications  Accusing the Company of deceit  they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab  It was refusing to pay taxes  writing disrespectful letters  and trying to humiliate the nawab and his officials  The Company on its part declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company  and trade could flourish only if the duties were removed  It was also convinced that to expand trade  it had to enlarge its settlements  buy up villages  and rebuild its forts  The conflicts led to confrontations and finally culminated in the famous Battle of Plassey  The Battle of Plassey When Alivardi Khan died in 1756  Sirajuddaulah became the nawab of Bengal  The Company was worried about his power and keen on a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges  So it tried  though without success  to help one of Sirajuddaulah  s rivals become the nawab  An infuriated Sirajuddaulah asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion  stop fortification  and pay the revenues  After negotiations failed  the Nawab marched with 30000 soldiers to the English factory at Kassimbazar  captured the Company officials  locked the warehouse  disarmed all Englishmen  and blockaded English ships  Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company  s fort there  On hearing the news of the fall of Calcutta  Company officials in Madras sent forces under the command of Robert Clive  reinforced by naval fleets  Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed  Finally  in 1757  Robert Clive led the Company  s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey  One of the main reasons for Did you know  Did you know how Plassey got its name  Plassey is an anglicised pronunciation of Palashi and the place derived its name from the palash tree known for its beautiful red flowers that yield gulal  the powder used in the festival of Holi  Fig  4  Robert Clive Puppet  Literally  a toy that you can move with strings  The term is used disapprovingly to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else  Rationalised 202324 FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY 13 the defeat of the Nawab was that the forces led by Mir Jafar  one of Sirajuddaulah  s commanders  never fought the battle  Clive had managed to secure his support by promising to make him nawab after crushing Sirajuddaulah  The Battle of Plassey became famous because it was the first major victory the Company won in India  Fig  5  The General Court Room  East India House  Leadenhall Street The Court of Proprietors of the East India Company had their meetings in the East India House on Leadenhall Street in London  This is a picture of one of their meetings in progress  The promise of riches The territorial ambitions of the mercantile East India Company were viewed with distrust and doubt in England  After the Battle of Plassey  Robert Clive wrote to William Pitt  one of the Principal Secretaries of State to the English monarch  on 7 January 1759 from Calcutta  But so large a sovereignty may possibly be an object too extensive for a mercantile Company  I flatter myself  that there will be little or no difficulty in obtaining the absolute possession of these rich kingdoms   Now I leave you to judge  whether an income yearly of two million sterling with the possession of three provinces  be an object deserving the public attention  Source 1 Fig  6  Sirajuddaulah Rationalised 202324 14 OUR PASTS  III After the defeat at Plassey  Sirajuddaulah was assassinated and Mir Jafar made the nawab  The Company was still unwilling to take over the responsibility of administration  Its prime objective was the expansion of trade  If this could be done without conquest  through the help of local rulers who were willing to grant privileges  then territories need not be taken over directly  Soon the Company discovered that this was rather difficult  For even the puppet nawabs were not always as helpful as the Company wanted them to be  After all  they had to maintain a basic appearance of dignity and sovereignty if they wanted respect from their subjects  What could the Company do  When Mir Jafar protested  the Company deposed him and installed Mir Qasim in his place  When Mir Qasim complained  he in turn was defeated in a battle fought at Buxar  1764   driven out of Bengal  and Mir Jafar was reinstalled  The Nawab had to pay Rs  500000 every month but the Company wanted more money to finance its wars  and meet the demands of trade and its other expenses  It wanted more territories and more revenue  By the time Mir Jafar died in 1765  the mood of the Company had changed  Having failed to work with puppet nawabs  Clive declared   We must indeed become nawabs ourselves   Finally  in 1765 the Mughal emperor appointed the Company as the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal  The Diwani allowed the Company to use the vast revenue resources of Bengal  This solved a major problem that the Company had earlier faced  From the early eighteenth century  its trade with India had expanded  But it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain  This was because at this time Britain had no goods to sell in India  The outflow of gold from Britain slowed after the Battle of Plassey  and entirely stopped after the assumption of Diwani  Now revenues from India could finance Company expenses  These revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India  maintain Company troops  and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta  Company officials become  nabobs  What did it mean to be nawabs  It meant of course that the Company acquired more power and authority  But it also meant something else  Each company servant began to have visions of living like nawabs  Source 2 The Nawab complains In 1733 the Nawab of Bengal said this about the English traders  When they first came into the country they petitioned the then government in a humble manner for liberty to purchase a spot of ground to build a factory house upon  which was no sooner granted but they built a strong fort  surrounded it with a ditch which has communication with the river and mounted a great number of guns upon the walls  They have enticed several merchants and others to go and take protection under them and they collect a revenue which amounts to Rs  100000 they rob and plunder and carry great number of the king  s subjects of both sexes into slavery into their own country  Rationalised 202324 FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY 15 After the Battle of Plassey  the actual nawabs of Bengal were forced to give land and vast sums of money as personal gifts to Company officials  Robert Clive himself amassed a fortune in India  He had come to Madras  now Chennai  from England in 1743 at the age of 18  When in 1767 he left India  his Indian fortune was worth 401102  Interestingly  when he was appointed Governor of Bengal in 1764  he was asked to remove corruption in Company administration but he was himself crossexamined in 1772 by the British Parliament which was suspicious of his vast wealth  Although he was acquitted  he committed suicide in 1774  However  not all Company officials succeeded in making money like Clive  Many died an early death in India due to disease and war  and it would not be right to regard all of them as corrupt and dishonest  Many of them came from humble backgrounds and their uppermost desire was to earn enough in India  return to Britain and lead a comfortable life  Those who managed to return with wealth led flashy lives and flaunted their riches  They were called  nabobs   an anglicised version of the Indian word nawab  They were often seen as upstarts and social climbers in British society and were ridiculed or made fun of in plays and cartoons  Company Rule Expands If we analyse the process of annexation of Indian states by the East India Company from 1757 to 1857  certain key aspects emerge  The Company rarely launched a direct military attack on an unknown territory  Instead it used a variety of political  economic and diplomatic methods to extend its influence before annexing an Indian kingdom  After the Battle of Buxar  1764   the Company appointed Residents in Indian states  They were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the Company  Through the Residents  the Company officials began interfering in the internal affairs of Indian states  They tried to decide who was to be the successor to the throne  and who was to be appointed in administrative posts  Sometimes  the Company forced the states into a  subsidiary alliance   According to the terms of this alliance  Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces  They were to be protected by the Company  but How did Clive see himself  At his hearing in front of a Committee in Parliament  Clive declared that he had shown admirable restraint after the Battle of Plassey  This is what he said  Consider the situation in which the victory at Plassey had placed me  A great prince was dependent on my pleasure  an opulent city lay at my mercy  its richest bankers bid against each other for my smiles  I walked through vaults which were thrown open to me alone  piled on either hand with gold and jewels  Mr Chairman  at this moment I stand astonished at my moderation  Source 3 Imagine that you are a young Company official who has been in India for a few months  Write a letter home to your mother telling

British Resident  painted by Tilly Kettle  oil  1772  The treaties that followed the Battle of Buxar forced Nawab Shujauddaulah to give up much of his authority  Here  however  he poses in regal splendour  towering over the Resident  Injunction  Instruction Subservience  Submissiveness had to pay for the  subsidiary forces  that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection  If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment  then part of their territory was taken away as penalty  For example  when Richard Wellesley was Governor General  17981805   the Nawab of Awadh was forced to give over half of his territory to the Company in 1801  as he failed to pay for the  subsidiary forces   Hyderabad was also forced to cede territories on similar grounds  What power did the Resident have  This is what James Mill  the famous economist and political philosopher from Scotland  wrote about the residents appointed by the Company  We place a resident  who really is king of the country  whatever injunctions of noninterference he may act under  As long as the prince acts in perfect subservience  and does what is agreeable to the residents  that is  to the British Government  things go on quietly  they are managed without the resident appearing much in the administration of affairs  but when anything of a different nature happens  the moment the prince takes a course which the British Government think wrong  then comes clashing and disturbance  James Mill  1832  Tipu Sultan  The  Tiger of Mysore  The Company resorted to direct military confrontation when it saw a threat to its political or economic interests  This can be illustrated with the case of the southern Indian state of Mysore  Mysore had grown in strength under the leadership of powerful rulers like Haidar Ali  ruled from 1761 to 1782  and his famous son Tipu Sultan  ruled from 1782 to 1799   Mysore controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom  In 1785  Tipu Sultan stopped the export of sandalwood  pepper and cardamom through the ports of his kingdom  and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company  He also established a close Fig  8  Tipu Sultan Rationalised 202324 FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY 17 relationship with the French in India  and modernised his army with their help  The British were furious  They saw Haidar and Tipu as ambitious  arrogant and dangerous  rulers who had to be controlled and crushed  Four wars were fought with Mysore  176769  178084  179092 and 1799   Only in the last  the Battle of Seringapatam  did the Company ultimately win a victory  Tipu Sultan was killed defending his capital Seringapatam  Mysore was placed under the former ruling dynasty of the Wodeyars and a subsidiary alliance was imposed on the state  Fig  10  Tipu  s toy tiger This is the picture of a big mechanical toy that Tipu possessed  You can see a tiger mauling a European soldier  When its handle was turned  the toy tiger roared and the soldier shrieked  This toytiger is now kept in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London  The British took it away when Tipu Sultan died defending his capital Seringapatam on 4 May 1799  Fig  9  Cornwallis receiving the sons of Tipu Sultan as hostages  painted by Daniel Orme  1793 The Company forces were defeated by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan in several battles  But in 1792  attacked by the combined forces of the Marathas  the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Company  Tipu was forced to sign a treaty with the British by which two of his sons were taken away as hostages  British painters always liked painting scenes that showed the triumph of British power  The legend of Tipu Kings are often surrounded by legend and their powers glorified through folklore  Here is a legend about Tipu Sultan who became the ruler of Mysore in 1782  It is said that once he went hunting in the forest with a French friend  There he came face to face with a tiger  His gun did not work and his dagger fell to the ground  He battled with the tiger unarmed until he managed to reach down and pick up the dagger  Finally  he was able to kill the tiger in the battle  After this  he came to be known as the  Tiger of Mysore   He had the image of the tiger on his flag  Rationalised 202324 18 OUR PASTS  III War with the Marathas From the late eighteenth century  the Company also sought to curb and eventually destroy Maratha power  With their defeat in the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761  the Marathas  dream of ruling from Delhi was shattered  They were divided into many states under different chiefs  sardars  belonging to dynasties such as Sindhia  Holkar  Gaikwad and Bhonsle  These chiefs were held together in a confederacy under a Peshwa  Principal Minister  who became its effective military and administrative head based in Pune  Mahadji Sindhia and Nana Phadnis were two famous Maratha soldiers and statesmen of the late eighteenth century  The Marathas were subdued in a series of wars  In the first war that ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai  there was no clear victor  The Second Anglo Maratha War  180305  was fought on different fronts  resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi  Finally  the Third AngloMaratha War of 181719 crushed Maratha power  The Peshwa was removed and sent away to Bithur near Kanpur with a pension  The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas  The claim to paramountcy It is clear from the above that from the early nineteenth century  the Company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion  Under Lord Hastings  GovernorGeneral from 1813 to 1823   a new policy of  paramountcy  was initiated  Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme  hence its power was greater than that of Indian states  In order to protect its interests  it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom  This view continued to guide later British policies as well  This process  however  did not go unchallenged  For example  when the British tried to annex the small state of Kitoor  in Karnataka today   Rani Channamma took to arms and led an antiBritish resistance movement  She was arrested in 1824 and died in prison in 1829  But Rayanna  a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor  carried on the resistance  With popular support  he destroyed many British camps and records  He was caught and hanged by the British in 1830  You will read more about several cases of resistance later in the book  Fig  11  Lord Hastings  Confederacy  Alliance Activity Imagine that you have come across two old newspapers reporting on the Battle of Seringapatam and the death of Tipu Sultan  One is a British paper and the other is from Mysore  Write the headline for each of the two newspapers   Fig  12  A Statue of the Queen of Kitoor  Karnataka  Rationalised 202324 FROM TRADE TO TERRITORY 19 In the late 1830s  the East India Company became worried about Russia  It imagined that Russia might expand across Asia and enter India from the northwest  Driven by this fear  the British now wanted to secure their control over the northwest  They fought a prolonged war with Afghanistan between 1838 and 1842  and established indirect Company rule there  Sind was taken over in 1843  Next in line was Punjab  But the presence of Maharaja Ranjit Singh held back the Company  After his death in 1839  two prolonged wars were fought with the Sikh kingdom  Ultimately  in 1849  Punjab was annexed  The Doctrine of Lapse The final wave of annexations occurred under Lord Dalhousie who was the GovernorGeneral from 1848 to 1856  He devised a policy that came to be known as the Doctrine of Lapse  The doctrine declared that if an Indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would  lapse   that is  become a part of Company territory  One kingdom after another was annexed simply by applying this doctrine  Satara  1848   Sambalpur  1850   Udaipur  1852   Nagpur  1853  and Jhansi  1854   Finally  in 1856  the Company also took over Awadh  This time the British had an added argument  they said they were  obliged by duty  to take over Awadh in order to free the people from the  misgovernment  of the Nawab  Enraged by the humiliating way in which the Nawab was deposed  the people of Awadh joined the great revolt that broke out in 1857  Fig  13  Maharaja Ranjit Singh holding court Fig  14  A portrait of Veer Surendra Sai Activity Imagine that you are a nawab

role in the expansion of Company power  By his time the Company had acquired power not only in Bengal  but also in Bombay and Madras  British territories were broadly divided into administrative units called Presidencies  There were three Presidencies  Bengal  Madras and Bombay  Each was ruled by a Governor  The supreme head of the administration was the Governor General  Warren Hastings  the first GovernorGeneral  introduced several administrative reforms  notably in the sphere of justice  From 1772 a new system of justice was established  Each district was to have two courts  a criminal court  faujdari adalat  and a civil court  diwani adalat   Maulvis and Hindu pandits interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts  The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti but under the supervision of the collectors  Qazi  A judge Mufti  A jurist of the Muslim community responsible for expounding the law that the qazi would administer Impeachment  A trial by the House of Lords in England for charges of misconduct brought against a person in the House of Commons Fig  15  The trial of Warren Hastings  painted by RG  Pollard  1789 When Warren Hastings went back to England in 1785  Edmund Burke accused him of being personally responsible for the misgovernment of Bengal  This led to an impeachment proceeding in the British Parliament that lasted seven years  Rationalised 202324 22 OUR PASTS  III A major problem was that the Brahman pandits gave different interpretations of local laws based on different schools of the dharmashastra  To bring about uniformity  in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws  NB  Halhed translated this digest into English  By 1778  a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges  Under the Regulating Act of 1773  a new Supreme Court was established  while a court of appeal  the Sadar Nizamat Adalat  was also set up at Calcutta  The principal figure in an Indian district was the Collector  As the title suggests  his main job was to collect revenue and taxes and maintain law and order in his district with the help of judges  police officers and darogas  His office  the Collectorate  became the new centre of power and patronage that steadily replaced previous holders of authority  The Company army Colonial rule in India brought in some new ideas of administration and reform but its power rested on its military strength  The Mughal army was mainly composed of cavalry  sawars  trained soldiers on horseback  and infantry  that is  paidal  foot  soldiers  They were given training in archery  teerandazi  and the use of the sword  The cavalry dominated the army and the Mughal state did not feel the need to have a large professionally trained infantry  The rural areas had a large number of armed peasants and the local zamindars often supplied the Mughals with paidal soldiers  A change occurred in the eighteenth century when Mughal successor states like Awadh and Benaras started recruiting peasants into their armies and training them as professional soldiers  The East India Company adopted the same method when it began recruitment for its own army  which came to be known as the sepoy army  from the Indian word sipahi  meaning soldier   As warfare technology changed from the 1820s  the cavalry requirements of the Company  s army declined  This is because the British empire was fighting in Burma  Afghanistan and Egypt where soldiers were armed with muskets and matchlocks  The soldiers of the Company  s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important  In the early nineteenth century  the British began to develop a uniform military culture  Soldiers were Here is a passage from Edmund Burke  s eloquent opening speech during the impeachment of Warren Hastings  I impeach him in the name of the people of India  whose rights he has trodden under his foot and whose country he has turned into a desert  Lastly in the name of human nature itself  in the name of both the sexes  in the name of every age  in the name of every rank  I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all  Source 5  I impeach the common enemy and oppressor of all  Dharmashastras  Sanskrit texts prescribing social rules and codes of behaviour

TRADE TO TERRITORY 23 increasingly subjected to Europeanstyle training  drill and discipline that regulated their life far more than before  Often this created problems since caste and community feelings were ignored in building a force of professional soldiers  Could individuals so easily give up their caste and religious feelings  Could they see themselves only as soldiers and not as members of communities  What did the sepoys feel  How did they react to the changes in their lives and their identity  that is  their sense of who they were  The Revolt of 1857 gives us a glimpse into the world of the sepoys  You will read about this revolt in Chapter 5  Conclusion Thus the East India Company was transformed from a trading company to a territorial colonial power  The arrival of new steam technology in the early nineteenth century also aided this process  Till then it would take anywhere between six and eight months to travel to India by sea  Steamships reduced the journey time to three weeks enabling more Britishers and their families to come to a faroff country like India  By 1857  the Company came to exercise direct rule over about 63 per cent of the territory and 78 per cent of the population of the Indian subcontinent  Combined with its indirect influence on the remaining territory and population of the country  the East India Company had virtually the whole of India under its control  Fig  16  A sawar of Bengal in the service of the Company  painted by an unknown Indian artist  1780 After the battles with the Marathas and the Mysore rulers  the Company
