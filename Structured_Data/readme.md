# Structured Data Assignment

Data Description:
The dataset provided contains four files:
1) **Train.parquet** - Training dataset.
2) **Test.parquet** - Testing dataset.
3) **Sample_submission.csv** - A sample CSV file illustrating the expected output.
4) **Final_submission.csv** - The CSV file to be submitted upon generating the output.

## Introduction

The dataset at hand comprises an extensive collection of electronic health records for patients diagnosed with a specific ailment. These records contain a detailed account of each patient's medical history, encompassing diagnoses, symptoms, prescribed drug treatments, and medical tests. Each entry in the dataset represents a healthcare event or medical record for a patient and includes a timestamp, providing a chronological perspective of the patient's medical journey. The core columns of the dataset are:

1) **Patient-Uid** - A unique alphanumeric identifier for each patient.
2) **Date** - The date of the healthcare event.
3) **Incident** - A description of the specific event that occurred on that day.

The primary goal of this assignment is to develop a predictive model to anticipate whether a patient will become eligible for a specific "Target Drug" within the next 30 days. The ability to predict eligibility in advance empowers healthcare professionals to make more informed and tailored treatment decisions, potentially leading to better patient outcomes.

The assignment involves the following steps:

**A. Data Preprocessing:**
- Cleaning and structuring the data, including handling null values, eliminating duplicates, and sorting entries chronologically.

**B. Feature Engineering:**
- Creating relevant features from the healthcare records, capturing aspects such as the time span between healthcare events and the frequency of certain incidents.

**C. Model Training:**
- Utilizing the XGBoost classifier to train a predictive model on the preprocessed data.

**D. Model Evaluation:**
- Assessing the model's performance using classification metrics such as F1 Score, accuracy, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

**E. Testing:**
- Applying the trained model to a test dataset to generate predictions for patients.

**F. Submission:**
- Creating a submission file with patient IDs and predicted labels.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our structured data assignment aims to develop a predictive model to identify a patient's eligibility for a specific "Target Drug" within the next 30 days. Through rigorous data preprocessing, feature engineering, and XGBoost model training, we have achieved promising results.

Our model demonstrates remarkable performance, with an F1 Score of 0.88, an accuracy of 0.92, and a robust ROC curve area of 0.97. These results signify the potential to revolutionize healthcare decision-making and enhance patient care by identifying treatment eligibility in advance.

Now, we turn our attention to Problem 2, where we delve into the analysis of drop-offs concerning the "Target Drug." We seek insights into the reasons patients discontinue this treatment. By examining the drop-off rate over different months and identifying events driving patients to stop taking the "Target Drug," we aim to generate valuable insights for healthcare professionals.
